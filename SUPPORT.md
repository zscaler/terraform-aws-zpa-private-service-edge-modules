# Community Supported

The software and templates in this repo are released under an AS-IS, best effort,
support policy. This software should be seen as community supported and Zscaler
will contribute our expertise as and when possible. We do not
provide technical support or help in using or troubleshooting the components of
the project through our normal support options such as Zscaler support teams,
or ASC (Authorized Support Centers) partners and backline
support options. The underlying product used (the Zscaler App Connector VM Appliances)
by the scripts or templates are still supported, but the support is only for the product
functionality and not for help in deploying or using the template or script
itself. Unless explicitly tagged, all projects or work posted in our GitHub
repository (at https://github.com/zscaler) or sites other than our
official support page on https://help.zscaler.com/login-tickets are provided
under the best effort policy.
